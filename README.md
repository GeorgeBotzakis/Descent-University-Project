# Descent-University-Project
The Final Project of Year 1 for the University.
Developed in 3 weeks, "Descent" was the final project for the first year of university. The lecturer instructed us to pick a main mechanic and build a game around it without worrying about assets or art direction. The goal was to examine design and implementation of an idea.

# Game Description
The main goal of the game was to get a high schore by collecting coins. The player asset was a cube that continiously descended in a not-so-randomly generated map. The map would keep going until the player loses with part of it being deleted when the player is far enough, out of view to save memory. The main mechanic was "wall-riding". When the player touches against a wall, their descent speed slows down and a heat meter builds up. When full, the player is launched off the wall, in order to prevent its continuous use. The main idea is to give the player an option to slow their speed to help them avoid obstacles

# Platform: Windows
